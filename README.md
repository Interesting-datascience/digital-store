# Digital Store
A pure digital store built on Python Django framework using ecommerce package.

## Purpose
With advent of Microservices framework and Cloud native architectures,
development of responsive mobile first Progressive web applications for ecommerce sites are order of the day. 
With ability to do daily deployments using Blue-Green deployment pattern, 
we want to realize the abstraction through Python Django web framework.

## Django eCommerce Framework
The motivation to use a boiler plate framework comes from the fact that, purchase process and customer experience is a vast area to be built from scratch. With the availability of Django eCommerce Framework we are able to extend it to build our cloud native architecture for a digital store.

## How to...
The Django eCommerce Framework powered by Django-SHOP uses cookiecutter to create a sample Shop App. Please follow <a href="https://github.com/awesto/cookiecutter-django-shop"> Cookie Cutter </a> README to set up. Alternatively, after following the python3 installation and cookie cutter installation, you can install <br>
a) Docker <br>
b) Clone this repository and go to storefront folder <br>
c) Spin up docker containers using docker-compose up --build -d <br>
d) Once done, reach out to your shop App using http://localhost:9009 <br>
e) To check status of running containers, in the terminal issue the command docker-compose ps <br>
f) To check logs of the containers issue the command docker-compose logs <br>
g) Finally to shutdown containers gracefully use docker-compose down and to forcefully use docker-compose kill <br>
h) Along with this, the docker-compose.yml generated by CookieCutter (in our case it is using runserver option for development purposes) contains 3 services namely, <br>
### POSTGRES (For DB) <br>
### REDIS (For Cache) <br>
### webapp -> epdasa/storefront (For serving customer requests and hosting shop app) <br>
