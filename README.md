# Digital Store
A pure digital store built on Python Django framework using ecommerce package.

## Purpose
With advent of Microservices framework and Cloud native architectures,
development of responsive mobile first Progressive web applications for ecommerce sites are order of the day. 
With ability to do daily deployments using Blue-Green deployment pattern, 
we want to realize the abstraction through Python Django web framework.

## Django eCommerce Framework
The motivation to use a boiler plate framework comes from the fact that, purchase process and customer experience is a vast area to be built from scratch. With the availability of Django eCommerce Framework we are able to extend it to build our cloud native architecture for a digital store.
